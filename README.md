**proEQUIB** - IDL/GDL library for atomic level populations and line emissivities in statistical equilibrium

### Description
The **proEQUIB** library is a collection of Interactive Data Language (IDL)/GNU Data Language (GDL) programs developed to calculate atomic level populations and line emissivities in statistical equilibrium in multi-level atoms for different physical conditions of the stratification layers where the chemical elements are ionized. This library includes the IDL/GDL version of the program EQUIB, which was originally written in FORTRAN by [Howarth & Adams (1981)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1981ucl..rept.....H), and was recently converted to IDL/GDL.
