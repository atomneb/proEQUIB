**proEQUIB** - IDL/GDL library for atomic level populations and line emissivities in statistical equilibrium

### Description
The **proEQUIB** library is a collection of [Interactive Data Language](http://www.harrisgeospatial.com/ProductsandSolutions/GeospatialProducts/IDL.aspx) (IDL)/[GNU Data Language](http://gnudatalanguage.sourceforge.net/) (GDL) programs developed to calculate atomic level populations and line emissivities in statistical equilibrium in multi-level atoms for different physical conditions of the stratification layers where the chemical elements are ionized. This library includes the IDL/GDL implementation of the program [EQUIB](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ascl.soft03005H), which was originally written in FORTRAN by [Howarth & Adams (1981)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1981ucl..rept.....H), and was recently converted to IDL/GDL. It also includes the IDL/GDL implementation of deredden functions from [STSDAS IRAF Package](http://www.stsci.edu/institute/software_hardware/stsdas), and atomic data from the [AtomNeb database](https://github.com/atomneb/AtomNeb-idl). It uses the IDL/GDL implementation of the [MIDAS](http://www.eso.org/~ohainaut/ccd/midas.html) scripts by X. W. Liu and codes from [MOCASSIN](https://github.com/mocassin/MOCASSIN-2.0) for some heavy element recombination emissivities. 

History of codes can be found [here](https://physics.mq.edu.au/~ashkbiz/proequib/history/).
